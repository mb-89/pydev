# pydev

[![Tests](https://github.com/mb-89/pydev/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mb-89/pydev/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

A helper for developing python modules.
The idea of this tool is to provide similar features to rusts cargo and to put all
configuration needed for version control, testing, building, publishing etc into one tool (pydev)
and one config file (pyproject.toml).

A similar tool is poetry (https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/#include-and-exclude),
however that didnt fit the niche that pydev occupies exactly.
